# UFO
## Overview

The request from a client was to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The client wanted the ability to filter by multiple criteria creating a dynamic website. The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website.

## Results

Welcome to our out of this world website UFO Sightings.

## Summary

### Changes:

What I suggest for change is as follows.
  - Change the code to have the filters automaticaly remove empty spaces at the end and have it change capital letters to lowercase so the data will be pulled correctly.
  - Change the date filter so it does not have to be date specifice but possibly week or month so the user will git more information.
  - Have a area for any photographs to be uploaded so the user could have more visual aids whlie reaserching.
